<objective>
Update the shared `.glass-card` and `.hover-lift` CSS classes in `globals.css @layer components` to warm amber tints, borders, glow effects, and a gold top-edge highlight — so every card in the app inherits the warm glassmorphism look without per-component changes.

Purpose: Cards are the primary UI surface in this dashboard. Shifting them from neutral/cool to warm amber-gold glassmorphism is the single most impactful visual change after the background foundation.

Output: Updated `.glass-card`, `.glass-card:hover`, `.hover-lift`, `.hover-lift:hover` rules in `src/app/globals.css` with warm amber tints, correct hover glow, inset top-edge highlight, and refined hover-lift behavior.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update .glass-card rest and hover states with warm tints, top-edge highlight, and amber hover glow</name>
  <files>src/app/globals.css</files>
  <action>
Edit the `.glass-card` and `.glass-card:hover` rules inside `@layer components` in `src/app/globals.css`. The current `.glass-card` block is at approximately lines 37-43 and `.glass-card:hover` at lines 45-48.

**Changes to `.glass-card` (rest state):**
1. Keep `background: var(--card)` unchanged (GLASS-01 base — already `rgba(30, 16, 4, 0.65)`)
2. Keep `backdrop-filter` and `-webkit-backdrop-filter` unchanged (locked in Phase 1)
3. Keep `border: 1px solid var(--card-border)` unchanged (GLASS-02 base — already `rgba(251, 191, 36, 0.2)`)
4. Keep `border-radius: 16px` unchanged
5. ADD `box-shadow: inset 0 1px 0 rgba(251, 191, 36, 0.35);` — GLASS-04: top-edge gold hairline, always visible, full width, respects border-radius naturally
6. ADD `transition: border-color 0.3s ease-out, background-color 0.3s ease-out, box-shadow 0.3s ease-out;` — ensures border-color/background/box-shadow changes animate on hover even without `.hover-lift` present. Per research Pitfall 2: this covers glass-cards that may not have hover-lift.

**Changes to `.glass-card:hover`:**
1. Change `border-color` from `rgba(251, 191, 36, 0.3)` to `rgba(251, 191, 36, 0.35)` — GLASS-02: user decision is 0.2 -> 0.35 (was 0.3, needs 0.35)
2. Replace `box-shadow: 0 0 30px rgba(245, 166, 35, 0.1)` with multi-layer box-shadow:
   ```
   box-shadow:
     inset 0 1px 0 rgba(251, 191, 36, 0.35),
     0 0 20px rgba(251, 191, 36, 0.18);
   ```
   First layer: GLASS-04 top-edge preserved (MUST match rest state — static highlight per user decision).
   Second layer: GLASS-03 outer amber halo — 20px spread (was 30px, user decision 15-25px), warm amber color.
   Per research Pitfall 1: box-shadow is NOT additive across rules — the hover rule MUST re-include the inset layer or it disappears.
3. ADD `background: rgba(40, 22, 6, 0.70);` — GLASS-01 hover: slightly brighter/warmer than base (user decision: "slightly brighter on hover", 0.65 -> 0.70). Per research Open Question 2: higher RGB values + slight opacity increase reads as subtle lift.

**DO NOT modify:** backdrop-filter values (locked Phase 1), `.neon-text`, `.neon-border`, `.gradient-text`, `.glow-cyan`, `.glow-purple`, `.sidebar-item` — those are Phase 3-5 scope.

    - .glass-card has inset top-edge gold highlight (box-shadow: inset 0 1px 0) at rest

    - .glass-card:hover has border-color at 0.35 opacity (not 0.3)

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update .hover-lift transition and hover state with warm amber behavior</name>
  <files>src/app/globals.css</files>
  <action>
Edit the `.hover-lift` and `.hover-lift:hover` rules inside `@layer components` in `src/app/globals.css`. The current `.hover-lift` block is at approximately lines 173-175 and `.hover-lift:hover` at lines 177-180.

**Changes to `.hover-lift`:**
Replace the current transition:
```css
transition: transform 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease;
```
With expanded transition covering all hover-changed properties:
```css
transition:
  transform 0.3s ease-out,
  box-shadow 0.3s ease-out,
  border-color 0.3s ease-out,
  background-color 0.3s ease-out;
```
Changes: (a) `ease` -> `ease-out` per user decision (Pitfall 4), (b) added `border-color` and `background-color` so `.glass-card:hover` changes animate when co-present (Pitfall 2).

**Changes to `.hover-lift:hover`:**
1. Change `transform: translateY(-4px)` to `transform: translateY(-2px)` — user decision: -2px subtle lift (Pitfall 3)
2. REMOVE `box-shadow: 0 20px 40px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)` entirely — GLASS-05: this is the neutral black shadow that must go. Per research: since all `.hover-lift` usages also have `.glass-card`, the shadow bloom is fully owned by `.glass-card:hover`. The `.hover-lift:hover` rule only needs the `transform`. Removing it prevents the neutral black from overriding the warm amber glow from `.glass-card:hover`.

The final `.hover-lift:hover` should be:
```css
.hover-lift:hover {
  transform: translateY(-2px);
}
```

**DO NOT modify:** Any other rules in the file. Only `.hover-lift` and `.hover-lift:hover`.

    <manual>Hover a card with hover-lift class. Card should gently rise ~2px (not the previous 4px). Shadow should be warm amber (from .glass-card:hover), not neutral black. Transition should feel smooth and elegant — ease-out gives a snappy start and gentle deceleration.</manual>

    - .hover-lift transition uses ease-out (not ease) for all 4 properties
    - .hover-lift transition covers transform, box-shadow, border-color, background-color
    - .hover-lift:hover uses translateY(-2px) (not -4px)
    - .hover-lift:hover has NO box-shadow (neutral black removed — GLASS-05 complete)
    - Combined hover of glass-card + hover-lift produces: -2px lift + warm amber glow + brighter border + warmer background — all animated at 300ms ease-out

  <name>Task 3: Visual verification of warm glass card system</name>
  <files>src/app/globals.css</files>
  <action>
Human visual verification checkpoint. No code changes — verify the warm glass card system looks correct.

What was built: Complete warm glass card system — amber-tinted rest state with gold top-edge hairline, hover effects including soft amber glow halo, border brightening, background warming, and refined -2px lift with warm shadow. All transitions at 300ms ease-out.

How to verify:
1. Open http://localhost:3000 in browser
2. Rest state check: Glass cards should show a thin gold/amber hairline along the top inside edge. Cards should have no resting glow — quiet and clean at rest.
3. Hover check: Hover over any glass card:
   - Border should visibly brighten (amber border gets stronger)
   - A soft amber glow halo should appear around the card (subtle, candlelight feel — NOT attention-grabbing)
   - Card background should get slightly warmer/lighter (subtle lift signal)
   - Card should rise ~2px (subtle, not jarring) if it has hover-lift class
4. Transition check: Move mouse on/off cards repeatedly. All changes (border, glow, background, lift) should animate smoothly together — no instant snaps, no properties lagging behind others
5. Shadow check: The hover shadow should be warm amber — NOT neutral black/gray. The previous dark shadow bloom should be gone.
6. Top-edge persistence: The gold hairline at the top should remain visible during hover (it should NOT disappear when the glow appears)

Resume signal: Type "approved" or describe specific issues to fix.

Automated checks:
- `grep -n "inset 0 1px 0 rgba(251, 191, 36" src/app/globals.css` returns exactly 2 results (rest + hover states)
- `grep -n "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)" src/app/globals.css` returns zero results (neutral black shadow removed)
- `grep -n "translateY(-2px)" src/app/globals.css` returns 1 result in hover-lift:hover
- `grep -n "translateY(-4px)" src/app/globals.css` returns zero results (old value removed)
- `grep -n "ease-out" src/app/globals.css` returns multiple results (transition timing updated)
- `grep -n "rgba(40, 22, 6, 0.70)" src/app/globals.css` returns 1 result in glass-card:hover
- `grep -n "from-indigo\|from-cyan\|from-purple" src/app/globals.css` returns hits ONLY from Phase 3-5 classes (gradient-text, neon-text, neon-border, glow-cyan, glow-purple, sidebar-item) — NOT from glass-card or hover-lift

Visual verification: User confirms warm glass card appearance in Task 3 checkpoint.
