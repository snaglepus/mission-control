## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Build order fixed — tokens first, then shared classes, then page frame, then view components, then sidebar
- Roadmap: Sidebar restructure (SIDE-03) deferred to Phase 5 so it doesn't entangle with palette work in Phases 3-4
- Roadmap: COMP-05 (Recharts chart colors) moved into Phase 4 scope — research confirms React prop mechanism differs from CSS but approach is clear

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: Exact amber shade for `--accent-gold` vs `--warning` distinction needs visual validation when both are rendered side-by-side — not a blocker, resolved during implementation
- Phase 1: Background saturation level (`#1a0f00` may read near-black) — apply `backdrop-filter: none` visibility test before proceeding to Phase 2
