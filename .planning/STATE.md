# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-24)

**Core value:** The dashboard must remain fully functional while transforming the visual identity to warm amber/gold glassmorphism
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Foundation)
Plan: 2 of TBD in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-24 — Plan 01-02 complete (ambient orbs, drift animations, Phase 1 visual approval)

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] ~10%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: ~3.5 min
- Total execution time: ~7 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 2 | ~7 min | ~3.5 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (~2 min), 01-02 (~5 min)
- Trend: —

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Build order fixed — tokens first, then shared classes, then page frame, then view components, then sidebar
- Roadmap: Sidebar restructure (SIDE-03) deferred to Phase 5 so it doesn't entangle with palette work in Phases 3-4
- Roadmap: COMP-05 (Recharts chart colors) moved into Phase 4 scope — research confirms React prop mechanism differs from CSS but approach is clear
- 01-01: --accent-gold (#f5a623) vs --warning (#E8720C) locked as visually distinct (gold ~40deg hue vs orange-red ~25deg hue)
- 01-01: --text-secondary warm gray-gold #c4a882 locked (no cool slate)
- 01-01: --danger warm coral/brick #dc6b4a locked (not pure red)
- 01-01: saturate(140%) chosen for backdrop-filter — rich bleed-through without oversaturation
- 01-02: Orb opacity range 0.25-0.5 — visible as distinct warm glow spots, not haze or dominant overlay
- 01-02: Three distinct warm sunset colors (gold, rose/burnt sienna, copper) for atmospheric depth variety
- 01-02: Drift displacement 20-40px max — stays in single compositor tile, no per-frame repaints
- 01-02: Phase 1 warm foundation visually approved by user (background, orbs, glass saturation, token distinction all pass)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None — Phase 1 foundation concerns (near-black background, backdrop-filter visibility, token distinction) all resolved during execution and confirmed via user visual approval in 01-02.
